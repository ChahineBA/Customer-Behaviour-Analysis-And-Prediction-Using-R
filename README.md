# Customer Behavior Analysis and Modeling with R üìäüîç

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior using **R**. The project focuses on exploring and visualizing customer data to identify patterns and trends, followed by modeling using advanced linear regression techniques.

## Features üåü
- **Data Exploration**: Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer characteristics and behaviors.
- **Visualizations**: Create a variety of visualizations using libraries like **ggplot2** to represent data insights, including:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps
- **Statistical Tests**: Implement various statistical tests to validate findings and understand the relationships between different variables.
- **Data Preparation for Modeling**: Prepare the dataset for modeling by cleaning and transforming data based on analysis results.
- **Modeling**: Apply linear regression techniques to the data, including:
  - **Lasso Regression**: Regularization technique to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.
  - **Ridge Regression**: Another regularization method that helps prevent overfitting by constraining the coefficients.

## Technologies Used üíª
- **R**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **ggplot2**: A powerful visualization library for creating informative graphics.
- **dplyr**: A package for data manipulation and transformation.
- **glmnet**: A package for fitting generalized linear and similar models via penalized maximum likelihood.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages designed for data science, which simplifies data analysis workflows.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of thorough data analysis and visualization in understanding customer behavior, as well as the application of linear regression techniques for modeling. By utilizing R and its powerful libraries, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can drive marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
